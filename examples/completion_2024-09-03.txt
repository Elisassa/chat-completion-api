The derivative of a function measures how that function changes as the values of its input change. In calculus, the derivative of x^2, denoted as d/dx[x^2] or simply (x^2)', is found using the power

This is a React functional component called FilterBox. Here's what it does:

- It uses the hooks `useState` and `useEffect`. 
- The `useState` hook is used to initialize and manage state variables for `selectedColumn`, `

This React component is a filter box that allows users to filter data based on columns, conditions, and values. It uses hooks to handle its state and effects.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- Importing necessary modules and types from React and the rest of your application.

- The `FilterBox` function component takes in several props: `columns`, `onRemoveFilter`, `index`, and `updateFilter`.

- Three pieces of state are created using the `useState` hook: `selectedColumn`, `condition`, and `value`, all initialized as empty strings.

- A `useEffect` hook is used to create a new filter object whenever `selectedColumn`, `condition`, or `value` changes. This filter object is then passed to the `updateFilter` function (passed in as a prop) with the given `index`.

- The component's render return consists of a `div` that contains a title (which includes the current filter number), a button to remove the filter, and a form with three inputs. The form includes two select boxes for the column and condition, and a text input for the value.

- The column select box is populated with options based on the `columns` prop. The condition select box has fixed options.

- The value for each input is tied to its respective piece of state (`selectedColumn`, `condition`, `value`), and the `onChange` event for each input updates its respective piece of state.

- The `onRemoveFilter` function is called when the 'x' button is clicked, presumably removing this filter from a list of filters managed by a parent component.

Overall, this code is well-structured and clean. Each piece of state and functionality seems to be well isolated and it's quite clear what each part of the code does.

The Chat Completion API is a command-line tool by Nonthachai Plodthong that enables interaction with the OpenAI Chat Completion API using Langchain. It allows users to send text prompts and receive AI-generated responses directly, with customizations like model, temperature, and token limits. The tool also supports various models and settings, outputs to a specified or default file, and includes error handling and logging. The tool is easy to install and is licensed under the MIT License.

# OpenAI Chat Completion CLI Tool

This is a command line interface (CLI) tool which interacts with the OpenAI API to generate text completions given an input text.

## Usage

Here is an example of how you can use this CLI tool:

```
python3 main.py --input_text "How to install Python?" --output output.txt --temperature 0.5 --max_tokens 150 --api_key "Your_OpenAI_API_Key" --model "gpt-3"
```

## Options

- `-h, --help, --howto`: Show the help message.
- `-v, --version`: Show the version of the tool.
- `--input_text, -i`: Input text to generate completion.
- `--output, -o`: Output file to save the generated completion.
- `--temperature, -t`: Temperature for the completion.
- `--max_tokens`: Maximum tokens for the completion.
- `--api_key, -a`: OpenAI API Key.
- `--model, -m`: Model for the completion.

## Functions

- `get_version()`: Get the version of the tool.
- `get_help()`: Get the help message.
- `get_input()`: Get the input text from command line argument.
- `get_output()`: Get the output file path from command line argument.
- `get_available_models()`: Retrieve the list of available models from OpenAI.
- `set_temperature()`: Set the temperature for the completion.
- `set_max_tokens()`: Set the maximum tokens for the completion.
- `set_api_key()`: Retrieve the API key from command line argument.
- `set_model()`: Retrieve the model from command line argument.
- `get_source()`: Get the source file path from command line argument.
- `get_completion()`: Get the chat completion from OpenAI API.

As an AI, I need you to provide the article you want me to summarize. The provided context is a dataset of different donuts with their characteristics, not an article.
2024-09-03 23:57:42:
Based on the data provided, the following topping options are available for the donuts:

1. None
2. Glazed
3. Sugar
4. Powdered Sugar
5. Chocolate with Sprinkles
6. Chocolate
7. Maple

Please note that not all toppings are available for all types of donuts. For instance, the "Chocolate with Sprinkles" and "Powdered Sugar" toppings are not available for the "Raised" and "Old Fashioned" donuts according to the data.

Sure, here is how you can represent the given JSON data in CSV format:

id,type,name,ppu,batters_id,batters_type,topping_id,topping_type
0001,donut,Cake,0.55,1001,Regular,5001,None
0001,donut,Cake,0.55,1002,Chocolate,5002,Glazed

0001,donut,Cake,0.55,, ,5003,Chocolate
0001,donut,Cake,0.55,, ,5004,Maple
0002,donut,Raised,0.55,1001,Regular,5001,None
0002,donut,Raised,0.55,, ,5002,Glazed

0003,donut,Old Fashioned,0.55,, ,5003,Chocolate
0003,donut,Old Fashioned,0.55,, ,5004,Maple

Please note that due to the nested structure of the JSON data, each donut's batter and topping types have been listed out in separate rows. If a donut has multiple batters and/or toppings, they will have multiple rows in the CSV.
