The derivative of a function measures how that function changes as the values of its input change. In calculus, the derivative of x^2, denoted as d/dx[x^2] or simply (x^2)', is found using the power

This is a React functional component called FilterBox. Here's what it does:

- It uses the hooks `useState` and `useEffect`. 
- The `useState` hook is used to initialize and manage state variables for `selectedColumn`, `

This React component is a filter box that allows users to filter data based on columns, conditions, and values. It uses hooks to handle its state and effects.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

- Importing necessary modules and types from React and the rest of your application.

- The `FilterBox` function component takes in several props: `columns`, `onRemoveFilter`, `index`, and `updateFilter`.

- Three pieces of state are created using the `useState` hook: `selectedColumn`, `condition`, and `value`, all initialized as empty strings.

- A `useEffect` hook is used to create a new filter object whenever `selectedColumn`, `condition`, or `value` changes. This filter object is then passed to the `updateFilter` function (passed in as a prop) with the given `index`.

- The component's render return consists of a `div` that contains a title (which includes the current filter number), a button to remove the filter, and a form with three inputs. The form includes two select boxes for the column and condition, and a text input for the value.

- The column select box is populated with options based on the `columns` prop. The condition select box has fixed options.

- The value for each input is tied to its respective piece of state (`selectedColumn`, `condition`, `value`), and the `onChange` event for each input updates its respective piece of state.

- The `onRemoveFilter` function is called when the 'x' button is clicked, presumably removing this filter from a list of filters managed by a parent component.

Overall, this code is well-structured and clean. Each piece of state and functionality seems to be well isolated and it's quite clear what each part of the code does.

The Chat Completion API is a command-line tool by Nonthachai Plodthong that enables interaction with the OpenAI Chat Completion API using Langchain. It allows users to send text prompts and receive AI-generated responses directly, with customizations like model, temperature, and token limits. The tool also supports various models and settings, outputs to a specified or default file, and includes error handling and logging. The tool is easy to install and is licensed under the MIT License.

# OpenAI Chat Completion CLI Tool

This is a command line interface (CLI) tool which interacts with the OpenAI API to generate text completions given an input text.

## Usage

Here is an example of how you can use this CLI tool:

```
python3 main.py --input_text "How to install Python?" --output output.txt --temperature 0.5 --max_tokens 150 --api_key "Your_OpenAI_API_Key" --model "gpt-3"
```

## Options

- `-h, --help, --howto`: Show the help message.
- `-v, --version`: Show the version of the tool.
- `--input_text, -i`: Input text to generate completion.
- `--output, -o`: Output file to save the generated completion.
- `--temperature, -t`: Temperature for the completion.
- `--max_tokens`: Maximum tokens for the completion.
- `--api_key, -a`: OpenAI API Key.
- `--model, -m`: Model for the completion.

## Functions

- `get_version()`: Get the version of the tool.
- `get_help()`: Get the help message.
- `get_input()`: Get the input text from command line argument.
- `get_output()`: Get the output file path from command line argument.
- `get_available_models()`: Retrieve the list of available models from OpenAI.
- `set_temperature()`: Set the temperature for the completion.
- `set_max_tokens()`: Set the maximum tokens for the completion.
- `set_api_key()`: Retrieve the API key from command line argument.
- `set_model()`: Retrieve the model from command line argument.
- `get_source()`: Get the source file path from command line argument.
- `get_completion()`: Get the chat completion from OpenAI API.
